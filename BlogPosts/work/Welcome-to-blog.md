## The Beginning

Hello and welcome to my blog! Here, I hope to share my thoughts on whatever comes to mind really, whether it be about a project, music, food, or something else entirely. It is also my intention that this might serve as a collection that I can look back on in the future and reflect on.  


## Why I Blog

Truth be told, I've been thinking about starting a blog for a long time now.

During my junior and senior years of high school, I started to really enjoy writing. I loved that it afforded me a pathway to crystallize my ideas and take them further. That is not to say, however, that writing came "easy" or naturally for me. It is, on the other hand, probably one of the most intellectually challenging things I've had to do. With writing, there's no formula that makes sense, no recipe that I can follow, no map with clear directions. Every piece is different, and comes with its own baggage. The only common thread is the voice in the back of your head that doesn't seem to shut up. 

The truth is, writing is imperfect and frustrating. Putting words on paper sometimes seems like the hardest thing to do, especially with an internal narrator criticizing every word. Getting to a final draft feels like a walking through broken glass, or a journey with no end in sight.

To blog, then, is to throw caution to the wind and let go of your writing. The beauty of it is in its imperfection, in its stark rawness. It's superficial, yet deep; no one wants to read a 10 page academic paper on their couch, so you try to communicate what you can in 800 well-measured words. And the best part is that anyone can write about anything, and once they hit publish, it's open for just about everyone to see. 

But, I digress. It is my hope that with this blog, I can jot down some of my thoughts as I go through life and experience new things. Granted, it probably won't be read all too much. But that's alright.
